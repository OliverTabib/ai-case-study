## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Khan Academy (Khanmigo)

* When was the company incorporated?
2008

* Who are the founders of the company?
Sal Khan founded the company with a dream of providing free and amazing education to anyone with
an internet connection.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Sal Khan was an MIT student who would tutor his family members, including his cousin Nadia,
cerca 2004. It came to his attention that other family members and friends really liked his tutoring
style, so he decided to make youtube tutorials of his teachings, which eventually led to the creation
of Khan Academy.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Khan Academy is a nonprofit organization; its funding primarily consists of donations from philanthropic organizations.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Khanmigo, which is the AI subsection of khan academy was created to provide an AI chatbot tutor for students around the world. Everyone has used the khan academy tutoring videos, and the large database of information that those videos provide is now being fed into their chatbot, allowing for easier access to the information that the student requires. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Similar to its not AI counterpart, (Khan Academy Videos), the khanmigo AI tutor isa designed for students and teachers alike that are trying to get an edge on their studies, or they are struggling with their studies. Currently, Khanmigo is only intended for users above the age of 18. 


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
In comparison to using the standard chatGPT 3 or 4 for tutoring, the khanmigo chatbot is much more informative, as it is trained on an extremely impressive database of knowledge from the normal khan academy videos that we all know and love. Khanmigo is built on the GPT model, so its ability to converse with the user is just as good as GPT standard, but it is a hyper specific model that teaches the user concepts in ways that the standard GPT model can not. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Khanmigo is built on the GPT-4 model. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Education. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
Prior to this innovation, I personally think that khan academy (sans AI) was and is one of the biggest marvels in education in the past 20 years. The education syste (in the USA) has not changed or innovated much in the last 10 years, but since the dawn of AI chatbots such as GPT, the education system has been forced to change within recent years. In my opinion, AI tutor bots such as Khanmigo are the biggest revoltion in education in the last 20 years and I am extremely excited to see what is next for this field, as I think education is extremely outdated and borderline useless with the current system of colleges, (especially given the financial respobsibility to these "institutions"). This form of education will soon be extremely accessable (free) and will allow humanity to prosper and learn in ways that we have never before, and will also grow the outreach of persons who can take advantage of education, since currently people who are less fortunate financially usually do not have access to great education. AI tools like this will bridge the financial gap in education quality, and hopefully fix our completely rigged system. 

* What are the other major companies in this field?
There do not seem to be many major players in this field, it is comprised of mostly smaller startups who are, similarly, building AI tutor chatbots on top of the GPT model. I believe this is because of big universities not wanting to be put out of buisiness by AI education, although I think it is inevidable. 
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
In all AI fields, including EdTech, there is a trend of worrying about the loss of jobs to the masses. When speaking about Khanmigo, Forbes has this say:

>"Will teachers become obsolete? The use of AI raises an important question: could AI-powered tools like Khanmigo make human teachers obsolete? Khan Academy firmly believes that tools like Khanmigo can alleviate some of the non-teaching tasks that currently consume up to 50% of a teacher's time. This could potentially reduce teacher workload, improve teacher retention, and free up more time for one-on-one student interaction – which will improve student outcomes and learning."

This is a very new era of EdTech, and these generative AI systems are not perfected for mass use. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Core metrics for EdTech success: User Engagement, Learning outcomes (higher test scores, improved skills, improved grades/educational acheivement), User Growth, Revenue growth, Customer satisfaction, platform scalability, innovation and adaptability. Khanmigo is performing well amoungst these categories, although it is still too early to tell whether it will be a disrupter in the market. 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Khanmigo is one of the biggest names in EdTech companies that have a generative AI tutor. Other competitors are not house hold names but include: Riid, Cognii, Elsa and memrise. All of which are aiming to bridge the gap between generative AI and human tutors. Khanmigo is currently leading the industry due to their vast database of video tutorials created by Sal Khan and collaborations with the leading generative AI company OpenAI, to integrate GPT 4 into their system. 
## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
A video marketing campaign that shows off the impactful features of the generative AI tutor would be very beneficial. As it will show students around the world how they can use this incredible tool to improve their skills, grades, etc. These AI systems are very daunting to many teachers and students alike, due to being correlated with cheating tactics, but I think a video compaign will explain how beneficial this tool can be to everyone in the Education field.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Although Google gemini is receiving backlash currently for its undeniably **weird** progressivism, their video that unvailed the product (Google Gemini Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIZAiXYceBI) made me extremely excited for their technology. I think that if Khanmigo made a similar style video that explain their capabilities to students, teachers and the like, would make the masses more open to trying a undeniably daunting technology. The education field (non- EdTech) has not changed much over the course of the last 100 years, the field itself is afraid of change and videos like this will help to alleviate the fear of AI within the education field.
