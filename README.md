# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Khan Academy (Khanmigo)

* When was the company incorporated?
2008

* Who are the founders of the company?
Sal Khan founded the company with a dream of providing free and amazing education to anyone with
an internet connection.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Sal Khan was an MIT student who would tutor his family members, including his cousin Nadia,
cerca 2004. It came to his attention that other family members and friends really liked his tutoring
style, so he decided to make youtube tutorials of his teachings, which eventually led to the creation
of Khan Academy.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Khan Academy is a nonprofit organization; its funding primarily consists of donations from philanthropic organizations.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Khanmigo, which is the AI subsection of khan academy was created to provide an AI chatbot tutor for students around the world. Everyone has used the khan academy tutoring videos, and the large database of information that those videos provide is now being fed into their chatbot, allowing for easier access to the information that the student requires. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Similar to its not AI counterpart, (Khan Academy Videos), the khanmigo AI tutor isa designed for students and teachers alike that are trying to get an edge on their studies, or they are struggling with their studies. Currently, Khanmigo is only intended for users above the age of 18. 


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
In comparison to using the standard chatGPT 3 or 4 for tutoring, the khanmigo chatbot is much more informative, as it is trained on an extremely impressive database of knowledge from the normal khan academy videos that we all know and love. Khanmigo is built on the GPT model, so its ability to converse with the user is just as good as GPT standard, but it is a hyper specific model that teaches the user concepts in ways that the standard GPT model can not. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Khanmigo is built on the GPT-4 model. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Education. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
Prior to this innovation, I personally think that khan academy (sans AI) was and is one of the biggest marvels in education in the past 20 years. The education syste (in the USA) has not changed or innovated much in the last 10 years, but since the dawn of AI chatbots such as GPT, the education system has been forced to change within recent years. In my opinion, AI tutor bots such as Khanmigo are the biggest revoltion in education in the last 20 years and I am extremely excited to see what is next for this field, as I think education is extremely outdated and borderline useless with the current system of colleges, (especially given the financial respobsibility to these "institutions"). This form of education will soon be extremely accessable (free) and will allow humanity to prosper and learn in ways that we have never before, and will also grow the outreach of persons who can take advantage of education, since currently people who are less fortunate financially usually do not have access to great education. AI tools like this will bridge the financial gap in education quality, and hopefully fix our completely rigged system. 

* What are the other major companies in this field?
There do not seem to be many major players in this field, it is comprised of mostly smaller startups who are, similarly, building AI tutor chatbots on top of the GPT model. I believe this is because of big universities not wanting to be put out of buisiness by AI education, although I think it is inevidable.
